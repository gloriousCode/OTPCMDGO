# OTPCMDGO
An incredibly basic OTP generator that reads your backup codes and generates the output in CMD. Written in Golang

It uses [pquerna's otp](https://github.com/pquerna/otp) to generate the code

## How to use
Place your entries inside _data.json_ (examples provided), run _go build_ then execute the application to view the 2FA codes in your console. Easier than getting your phone out every 10 seconds
